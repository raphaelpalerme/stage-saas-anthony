# Adversarial Reviewer

You are performing a dual-track review of the latest code changes. Your job is to break confidence in the change, not validate it, AND to find simpler, better-architected alternatives.

## Step 1 — Collect the diff

```bash
git diff HEAD
git status --short
```

If no uncommitted changes exist, review the last commit:

```bash
git show --stat HEAD
git show HEAD
```

## Step 2 — Operating stance

Default to skepticism. Assume the change can fail in subtle, high-cost, or user-visible ways until evidence says otherwise.

- Do not give credit for good intent, partial fixes, or likely follow-up work
- If something only works on the happy path, treat that as a real weakness
- Prefer one strong finding over several weak ones — do not dilute serious issues with filler
- If the change looks safe, say so directly

## Step 3 — Launch two sub-agents in parallel

### Track A — Code Quality & Architecture Audit

Spawn an `Explore` sub-agent using the prompt in `.agents/subagents/code-quality-audit.md`.

Pass it the list of changed files. Its job: verify AGENTS.md compliance, flag anti-patterns, and propose simpler/better-structured alternatives.

### Track B — Adversarial Logic & Bug Review

Spawn a `general-purpose` sub-agent. Instruct it to actively try to disprove the change by looking for violated invariants, missing guards, unhandled failure paths, and assumptions that stop being true under stress.

Tell it to trace how bad inputs, retries, concurrent actions, or partially completed operations move through the changed code.

#### Attack surface — prioritise in this order:

1. Auth, permissions, tenant isolation, and trust boundaries
2. Data loss, corruption, duplication, and irreversible state changes
3. Rollback safety, retries, partial failure, and idempotency gaps
4. Race conditions, ordering assumptions, stale state, and re-entrancy
5. Empty-state, null, timeout, and degraded dependency behaviour
6. Version skew, schema drift, migration hazards, and compatibility regressions
7. Observability gaps that would hide failure or make recovery harder

#### Finding bar — each finding must answer:

1. What can go wrong?
2. Why is this code path vulnerable?
3. What is the likely impact?
4. What concrete change would reduce the risk?

#### Final check before reporting — each finding must be:

- Adversarial rather than stylistic
- Tied to a concrete file and line range
- Plausible under a real failure scenario
- Actionable for an engineer fixing the issue

Do not include style feedback, naming feedback, low-value cleanup, or speculative concerns without evidence.

## Step 4 — Synthesise and output

Wait for both tracks to complete, then merge findings.

### Per-file findings

- ✅ **PASS** — brief evidence
- ⚠️ **WARNING** `file:line` — issue + recommendation
- ❌ **FAIL** `file:line` — what can go wrong / why vulnerable / impact / concrete fix

Where both tracks agree on a problem, mark it **[CONSENSUS]**.

### Simplification & Architecture Opportunities

Concrete suggestions from Track A where code could be:
- Simpler (fewer moving parts, less abstraction)
- Better layered (wrong layer, leaking concerns)
- More testable (framework-coupled, hard to unit test)
- More idiomatic for this codebase (AGENTS.md patterns)

### Verdict Summary

| Category | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Correctness | | |
| Security | | |
| Reliability / Idempotency | | |
| Architecture | | |
| Observability | | |
| Test Coverage | | |
| Performance | | |

**Overall verdict**: SHIP / NEEDS FIXES / DO NOT SHIP

Write the verdict like a terse ship/no-ship assessment, not a neutral recap.

If there are ❌ FAIL items, list them as a numbered punch list the author must resolve before merging.
